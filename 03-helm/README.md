# 🟨 Phase 3 — Helm

Goal: Understand templating and release management.

#### Topics:

- Chart structure
- values.yaml
- Template rendering
- Install, upgrade, rollback
- Environment overrides

You will convert earlier raw YAML into Helm charts and simulate versioned releases.

#### Key concept:

Helm manages releases. Kubernetes manages state.
